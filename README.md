# WAVE-TRANSFORMER
## Project Overview
### This repository contains the source code for a digital signal processing (DSP) application. The application provides various functionalities for signal analysis and visualization, including Fourier transform, and DTFT.

### There 2 Versions in this project one version that i build from scratch and the other version that i used the existing functions in it.





## Features
1- Convert an image to a 1D signal array

2- Perform Fourier transform on a signal using FFT

4- Visualize the transformed signals using a chart


## Technologies Used
1- C# programming language

2- .NET Framework

3- Windows Forms for GUI (Graphical User Interface)

4- MathNet.Numerics library for mathematical operations and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)


## Getting Started
### To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository: $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2- Open the solution file (Project.sln) in Visual Studio.

3- Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the project.

4- Run the application to launch the GUI.


## Usage
1- Open an image file by clicking the "Open" button.

2- Perform Fourier series, Fourier transform, or DTFT on the loaded image using the corresponding buttons.

3- View the transformed signals in a chart.

4- Adjust the chart settings (range, axis labels, etc.) using the input fields provided.

5- Close the application when finished.
